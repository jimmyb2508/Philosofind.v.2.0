# Method
The frontend was built using React. The app features a node.js Express API which utilizes a Mongo DB database.

# Potential Improvements
1. The API could do with a bespoke domain name but Heroku wanted me to pay
2. Randomized background images 
3. The ability to print screen and post to social media
4. An online shop with Philosofind Merch.
